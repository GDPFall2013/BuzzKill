========

A Side Scrolling Game about a man trying to survive a trip to Mars (Written in Dart)


The year is 2025.  Signs of life have been discovered on Mars, but not the kinds of life people usually hear about on mars.  Something much bigger.  To avoid a widespread hysteria the U.N. secretly sends their best astronaut to investigate, Buzz  Armstrong.  After a year of travel alone in the ship, something goes wrong while entering the atmosphere and parts of his ship begin to break up in orbit.  Buzz sees the pieces break off and fall across the planet as he lands.  The ship lands mostly intact, but he quickly sees he can’t take off without recovering several key pieces of equipment, and equally important almost all his spare oxygen capsules have broken off!   Buzz realizes he will have to act quickly to gather oxygen before he suffocates.  His contacts at NASA tell him to abandon the alien life discovery mission, and instead focus on recovering the pieces of his ship to return home.  But Buzz has a strong feeling he’ll encounter the residents of mars along the way…...


BuzzKill is an action packed side scroller in which its a race against time for the main character to make it off the planet.  You'll have to collect oxygen while searching for the missing pieces of your ship, all the while contending with the "natives".


This game was created as a project for a Software engineering studio class at Depaul by a team of three.  The code is in the new web language Dart, and it is written as a chrome app.  The chrome web store is the first target for deployment
